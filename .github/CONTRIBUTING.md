## Here you will find how to propery contribute to this repository

## Creating a branch

The first step is to create a branch that will contain all of a certain feature's work.

To do this, run the following command:

`git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`
.
This will create a new branch, and switch to the newly created branch.

## Committing and pushing upstream

While working, it is imperative you consistently commit and push upstream.

Follow these few steps:

Make sure all files are added either by running `git add <filename>`

Alternatively, run `git add .` to add all files.

Once added, commit the files and add a descriptive message like so:

`git commit -m "MESSAGE GOES HERE"`

Finally, push the commit upstream with the following command:

`git push -u origin <branch-name-here>`

## Pull Request

Once you finish the feature, create a pull request on the github website and write a description of the branch

Click `Create pull request` and voila, you have officially requested to merge your branch back into master

The PR will be reviewed and then either modified or accepted

## Resetting for the next branch

Before you create a new branch for a new feature, make sure to pull the latest master so you have the most updated repo

Then, after the acceptance of the PR, delete the old local branch like so.

First pull to get the updated changes.

`git pull`

Then switch to the main branch.

`git checkout master`

Finally, to delete your feature branch, use the following command:

`git branch -d <branch-name-here>`
